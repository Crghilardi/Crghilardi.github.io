This serves as a compilation of open source projects I have either authored or (try to...) contribute to regularly.

# [ForestBiometrics.jl](https://github.com/Crghilardi/ForestBiometrics.jl)

This is a package for forest statistics and biometrics in the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/). I firdt got interested in Julia while in grad school and saw how the language was being used to create really interesting projects. My long term goal with this is a domain specific language for forest modeling needs that is easy to use and performant. This was my first project from scratch to publishing on a package manager and I learned a lot during that whole process.

# [InventoryErrorMLSolutions](https://github.com/New-Jersey-Forest-Service/InventoryErrorMLSolutions)

This is a meta-project that sprung out of dicussions on issues faced and the rapid development of other fields and industries. The group meets weekly to discuss ideas and collaborate.

# [FIAPI](https://github.com/New-Jersey-Forest-Service/FIAPI)

This is a python library that makes interacting with [FIA data](https://www.fia.fs.fed.us/tools-data/index.php) easier. There is also a [R version](https://github.com/New-Jersey-Forest-Service/EVALIDatR) with the same functionality under a different name that I wrote.

# [Connective C++](https://github.com/connectivecpp)

I got involved with this group through the [Seattle C++ meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-C-Meetup). chops-net-ip is a C++ library for asynchronous network programming.

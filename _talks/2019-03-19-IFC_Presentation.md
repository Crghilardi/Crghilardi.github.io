This was a presentation at the [Intermountain Forestry Cooperative (IFC)](https://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/intermountain-forestry-cooperative) annual meeting in Moscow, ID. I give a brief intro to some of the concepts of open source software and then expand into some specific examples relevant to forestry.
